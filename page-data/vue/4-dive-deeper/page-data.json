Now check inside the style tag for part of interest 2, you can see some style applied to \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"a.router-link-exact-active\"), \".

The \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"routes\"), \" array. Each object inside the array defines a particular route. The first Object defines the properties of route '/'. The route is named 'Home'. Also there's \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"component\"), \" property which is defined as \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Home\"), \". This \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Home\"), \" or \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Home.vue\"), \" is the component or page which will be rendered when we are on the URL http://localhost:PORT/. Easy isn't it? Look at the third imported file. No Magic there, it's the \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Home\"), \" page imported from \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"views\"), \" directory, which contains all the single page components. The second route object named 'About' has the route \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"path\"), \" defined as '/about' and /src/views/About.vue file imported as \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"component\"), \". What did you learn from all this? \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Every route is defined with a Vue Component which will be rendered when the browser is in the exact path which is defined in that route\"), \". Also you've to import every component registered to each routes inside the \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"index.js\"), \" of \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"/src/router/\"), \" directory.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Now, back to \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"<router-view\"), \", what exactly does \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"<router-view>\"), \" do? The \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"<router-view>\"), \" is the placeholder tag where the component registered in the active route renders. Got it? Let's make it simple for you. When the URL is http://localhost:PORT/, the route named 'Home' is matched, and the component registered in that route, \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Home\"), \", is rendered in the place of \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"<router-view>\"), \" tag. Similarly, On http://localhost:PORT/about, \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"About\"), \" component is rendered in place of the \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"<router-view>\"), \". If I'm still not clear, you can check the browser developer tools(Ctrl + Shift + I) in the Elements Tab, comparing to the App.vue file \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"<template>\"), \". That'll give you an approximate idea on what's happening. So, now you've learned how routing works. Just create your app with \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Vue-router\"), \" feature, define your routes and components inside the router \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"index.js\"), \" file, use \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"<router-link>\"), \" to navigate between pages and \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"<router-view>\"), \" renders the current page inside the \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"App.vue\"), \". A nice little summary. You can use \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"<router-link>\"), \" to provide clickable links in the page for navigation. What about programmatically navigating? Suppose, you have to redirect from a page when a certain condition is satisfied. We cannot handle that situation with \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"<router-link>\"), \". For that purpose, we can use \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"$router.push()\"), \" API. The argument of \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"$router.push()\"), \" API can be the following:\"), mdx(\"ul\", null, mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"li\"\n  }, \"$router.push('/') // Reroutes to Home Page\")), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"li\"\n  }, \"$router.push({name:'About'}) // Reroutes to about page\")), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"li\"\n  }, \"$router.push({path:'/about'}) // About page\"))), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Simple as that. Things will become more handy when we go further forward. If you have time, just wander around in our app directory and try to link things together, understand how everything is placed and their positions. Now let's move on to actual programming than learning.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","tableOfContents":{"items":[{"url":"#diving-deep-into-vuejs","title":"Diving deep into Vue.js","items":[{"url":"#router-view","title":"router-view"}]}]},"parent":{"__typename":"File","relativePath":"vue/4-dive-deeper.md"},"frontmatter":{"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null}},"allMdx":{"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/angular","title":"Angular"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/git","title":"Git"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/","title":"Developer's Guide"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/introduction","title":"Introduction"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/linux","title":"Linux"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/nativescript","title":"Nativescript"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/newcomers-references","title":"Newcomers References"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/newcomers","title":"Newcomers"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/python","title":"Python"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/style-guide","title":"Style Guide"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/react","title":"React"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/ui-mastery","title":"Ui Mastery"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/vue","title":"Vue"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/linux/shell","title":"Shell"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/react/Tutorial","title":"Tutorial - Beginner"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/ui-mastery/1-Introduction","title":"Introduction"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/ui-mastery/10-SASS-introduction","title":"SASS"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/ui-mastery/11-SCSS-introduction","title":"SCSS"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/ui-mastery/12-workshop-practice-3","title":"Workshop practice 3"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/ui-mastery/13-UI-debug-tools","title":"UI Debug Tools"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/ui-mastery/14-Optimization","title":"Optimization"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/ui-mastery/15-UI-standards","title":"UI standards"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/ui-mastery/2-HTML","title":"HTML"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/ui-mastery/3-HTML-Accessibility","title":"HTML Accessibility"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/ui-mastery/4-CSS","title":"CSS"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/ui-mastery/5-JS-basics","title":"JS basics"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/ui-mastery/6-workshop-practice-1","title":"Workshop practice 1"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/ui-mastery/7-flexbox-and-media-query","title":"Learn CSS Flexbox & Media Queries"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/ui-mastery/8-Introduction-of-bootstrap","title":"Bootstrap Basics"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/ui-mastery/9-workshop-practice-2","title":"Workshop practice 2"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/vue/1-what-and-why-Vue","title":"1 What And Why Vue"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/vue/2-getting-started","title":"2 Getting Started"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/vue/3-data-and-props","title":"3 Data And Props"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/vue/4-dive-deeper","title":"4 Dive Deeper"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/vue/5-getting-started-chapter-2","title":"5 Getting Started Chapter 2"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/vue/6-the-final-problem-part-2","title":"6 The Final Problem Part 2"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/vue/7-conclusion","title":"7 Conclusion"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/react/Tutorial/1-what-and-why-react","title":"1 What And Why React"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/react/Tutorial/2-setting-things-up","title":"2 Setting Things Up"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/react/Tutorial/3-states-props-and-more-part1","title":"3 States Props And More Part 1"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/react/Tutorial/4-states-props-and-more-part2","title":"4 States Props And More Part 2"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/react/Tutorial/5-useEffect","title":"5 Use Effect"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/react/Tutorial/6-conclusion","title":"6 Conclusion"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/react/style-guide/style-guide","title":"Style Guide"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"b4d95ea3-9f5b-507a-b123-d4441a51a269"}}}
