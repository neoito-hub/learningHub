HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language used to describe the structure of a web page. It uses a special syntax or notation to organize and give information about the page to the browser. Elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example, there are different tag options to place around text to show whether it is a heading, a paragraph, or a list.

Example: 

```
<h1>Top level heading: Maybe a page title</h1>

<p>A paragraph of text. Some information we would like to communicate to the viewer. This can be as long or short as we would like.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Number one on the list</li>
  <li>Number two</li>
  <li>A third item</li>
</ol>
```
