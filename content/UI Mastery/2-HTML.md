### What is HTML

* HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
* HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
* HTML describes the structure of a Web page
* HTML consists of a series of elements
* HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
* HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

### HTML <!DOCTYPE>

The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.\
In HTML 5, the declaration is simple:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

### HTML Layout Technique - CSS Flexbox Layout

Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:

*	Block, for sections in a webpage
*	Inline, for text
*	Table, for two-dimensional table data
*	Positioned, for explicit position of an element

The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.\
<br>
Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.
